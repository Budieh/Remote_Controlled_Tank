All the necessary details regarding the project can be found either in the coresponding text files either as comments inside of the C / Matlab files <br /> 
Even though the main language used in the development process of this project is Romanian, I made sure that the comments used inside of the C files ( that explain the functionality of the code uploaded to the board ) are written in English <br /> 
Have a nice read, I hope the contents of this project can aid you in your personal work <br /> 
Future updates will include schematics for the custom circuit boards, wiring diagrams and photos/videos of the final product <br />
